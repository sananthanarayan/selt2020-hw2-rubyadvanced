Skeleton Code
=============

The skeleton code files for parts 1-5 are located in the `lib/` directory .

Running Sanity Specs
====================
To run the rspec sanity checks for part 1 type the following command while
in the parent directory of the `lib and `spec directories:

```bash
rspec spec/part1_spec.rb`
```

The output should look something like:

```
    ...
    Finished in 0.00206 seconds
    3 examples, 0 failures
```

The commands for parts 2-5 are similar.

```
    NOTE: Passing the sanity check does not, in any way, insure that your code is
    correct.  The sanity check simply insures that your code conforms to the basic
    specificaton necessary to be tested by our automated testing tools.

    NOTE:  The private automated testing tools have many more checks for correctness
    than are provided in the public tests provided to you.
```

# Problem Statement

In this homework you will complete several programming exercises to gain additional familiarity with the Ruby language.
Skeleton code for each part of the assignment is in the lib/ directory of the repo.
Unlike HW1, where we provided the complete test spec for the assignment, for this assignment we are providing
only a "bare-bones" set of sanity-check tests.  This means you will need to be very careful to correctly
implement the components of the assignment, since you will not be able to rely upon the provided
 failing tests to alert you to things you have missed.  
Hopefully this assignment will convince you of the advantages of generating a good set of
tests prior to writing the software solution.

NOTE:  For all questions involving words or strings, you may assume that the definition of a "word" is: a sequence
of characters whose boundaries are matched by the \b construct in Ruby regexps.


## Part 1: Strings and Regexps

1. Write a method that determines whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome — i.e. it reads the same backwards
as forwards, ignoring case, punctuation, and non-word characters.  (a "non-word character" is defined for our
purposes as: a character that Ruby regexps would treat as a non-word character.)  Your solution should not use
loops or iteration of any kind.   You will find regular-expression syntax very useful; it is reviewed briefly in
the text and the website [http://rubular.com]:http://rubular.com will allow you to try out Ruby regular expressions
 "live".  Methods you
might find useful (which you will need to look up in the Ruby documentation, at [ruby-doc.org]:ruby-doc.org) include:
String#downcase, String#gsub, String#reverse

    Examples:
    ```ruby
    palindrome?("A man, a plan, a canal -- Panama")  #=> true
    palindrome?("Madam, I'm Adam!")  # => true
    palindrome?("Abracadabra")  # => false (nil is also ok)

    def palindrome?(string)
      # your code here
    end
    ```

1. Given a string of input, return a hash whose keys are words in the string and whose values are the number of
 times each word appears.  Do not use for-loops.  (But iterators such as each are permitted.)  Non-words should be
 ignored.  Case does not matter.  A word is defined as a string of characters between word boundaries.
 (Hint: the element `\b` in a Ruby Regexp means "word boundary".)

    Example:
    ```ruby
    count_words("A man, a plan, a canal -- Panama")
    # => {'a' => 3, 'man' => 1, 'canal' => 1, 'panama' => 1, 'plan' => 1}
    count_words "Doo bee doo bee doo"  # => {'doo' => 3, 'bee' => 2}

    def count_words(string)
      # your code here
    end
    ```

## Part 2: Nested arrays and recursion: Rock-Paper-Scissors
In a game of rock-paper-scissors, each player chooses one object from Rock (`R`), Paper (`P`), or Scissors (`S`).
The rules are: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, but Paper beats Rock.

A rock-paper-scissors game is encoded as a list, where the elements are 2-element lists that encode a player’s name
 and a player’s chosen object.

```ruby
 [ [ "John", "P" ], [ "Mary", "S" ] ]
 # => returns the list ["Mary", "S"] wins since S>P
```

1.  Write a method `rps_game_winner` that takes a two-element list and behaves as follows:
    - If the number of players is not equal to 2, `raise WrongNumberOfPlayersError`
    - If either player's strategy is something other than `R`, `P` or `S` (case-insensitive),
    `raise NoSuchStrategyError`
    - Otherwise, return the name and strategy of the winning player.  If both players use the same strategy,
    the first player is the winner.

    We'll get you started:

    ```ruby
    class WrongNumberOfPlayersError < StandardError ; end
    class NoSuchStrategyError < StandardError ; end

    def rps_game_winner(game)
      raise WrongNumberOfPlayersError unless game.length == 2
      # your code here
    end
    ```

1. A rock, paper, scissors tournament is encoded as a bracketed array of games - that is, each element can be
considered its own tournament.
    ```ruby
    [
     [
       [ ["Joe", "P"], ["Mary", "S"] ],
       [ ["Bob", "R"],  ["Alice", "S"] ]
     ],
     [
       [ ["Steve", "S"], ["Jane", "P"] ],
       [ ["Ted", "R"], ["Carol", "P"] ]
     ]
    ]
    ```

    Under this scenario, Mary would beat Joe (`S>P`), Bob would beat Alice (`R>S`), and then Mary and Bob would play
    (Bob wins since `R>S`); similarly, Steve would beat Jane, Carol would beat Ted, and Steve and Carol would play
    (Steve wins since `S>P`); and finally Bob would beat Steve since `R>S`, that is, continue until there is only a
    single winner.
    *	Write a method `rps_tournament_winner` that takes a tournament encoded as a bracketed array and returns the
     winner (for the above example, it should return [“Bob”,“R”]).
    *	Tournaments can be nested arbitrarily deep, i.e., it may require multiple rounds to get to a single winner.
      You can assume that the initial array is well formed (that is, there are 2^n players, and each one participates
      in exactly one match per round).

## Part 3: Basic OOP in Ruby
1. Create a `class Dessert` with getters and setters for instance
variables `@name` and `@calories`.
Define instance method `healthy?`, that returns true if a dessert 
has less than 200 calories, and instance
method delicious?, that returns true for all desserts.

1. Create a `class JellyBean` that extends `Dessert`, and add a getter and setter for instance
variable `@flavor`.  Override `delicious?` to return `false` if the flavor is “black licorice”
(but `delicious?` should still return true for all other flavors and for all non-`JellyBean` desserts).

    Here is the framework (you may define additional helper methods):

    ```ruby
    class Dessert
      #remember, you need to define getters and setters for
        #instance variables @name and @calories
      def initialize(name, calories)
        # YOUR CODE HERE
      end

      def healthy?
        # YOUR CODE HERE
      end

      def delicious?
        # YOUR CODE HERE
      end
    end

    class JellyBean < Dessert
      #Remember, you need a getter and setter for instance var. @flavor
      def initialize(name, calories, flavor)
        # YOUR CODE HERE
      end

      def delicious?
        # YOUR CODE HERE
      end
    end
    ```

## Part 4: Meta-programming and open classes

In lecture we saw how `attr_accessor` uses meta-programming to create getters and setters for object attributes
 on the fly.
An indepth description on `attr_accessor` can be found at <https://medium.com/@amliving/diving-into-rubys-attr-accessor-d34e2ccc5477>.
 
Define a method `attr_accessor_with_history` that provides the same functionality as `attr_accessor` but also
tracks every value the attribute has ever had:

````ruby
class Foo
  attr_accessor_with_history :bar
end

f = Foo.new     # => #<Foo:0x127e678>
f.bar = 3       # => 3
f.bar = :wowzo  # => :wowzo
f.bar = 'boo!'  # => 'boo!'
f.bar_history # => [nil, 3, :wowzo, 'boo!']
````

Here are some important hints and things to notice to get you started:
1.	The first thing to notice is that if we define `attr_accessor_with_history` in `class Class`,
 we can use it as in the snippet above. This is because, in Ruby, a class is simply an object
  of class Class.  (If that makes your brain hurt, just don't worry about it for now.  It'll
  come.)
2.	The second thing to notice is that Ruby provides a method `class_eval` that takes a string
 and evaluates it in the context of the current class, that is, the class from which you're
  calling `attr_accessor_with_history`.  This string will need to contain a method definition
  that implements a setter-with-history for the desired attribute `attr_name`.
3.	`#bar_history` should always return an Array of elements, even if no values have been
assigned yet.

*	Don't forget that the very first time the attribute receives a value, its history array will have to be initialized.
*	Don't forget that instance variables are referred to as `@bar` within getters and setters, as Section 3.4
of the text explains.
*	Although the existing `attr_accessor` can handle multiple arguments (e.g. `attr_accessor :foo, :bar`), your
version just needs to handle a single argument.  However, it should be able to track
 multiple instance variables per class, with any legal class names or variable names, so it
  should work if used this way:

      ```ruby
      class SomeOtherClass
        attr_accessor_with_history :foo
       attr_accessor_with_history :bar
      end

      ```
*	History of instance variables should be maintained separately for each object instance. That is, if you do
      ```ruby
      f = Foo.new
      f.bar = 1
      f.bar = 2
      f = Foo.new
      f. bar = 4
      f.bar_history
      ```

      then the last line should just return [nil,4], rather than [nil,1,2,4]

      Here is the skeleton to get you started:

      ```ruby
      class Class
        def attr_accessor_with_history(attr_name)
          attr_name = attr_name.to_s   # make sure it's a string
          #Use the existing attr_reader method to create the attribute’s
          # getter method
          attr_reader attr_name
          #Use the existing attr_getter method to create a getter method
          #for the @<attr_name>_history instance variable, which will hold
          #the attribute’s history, as an array
          attr_reader attr_name+"_history"
           #Now for the interesting part. You need to define a setter
        #method named <attr_name>= that sets the attribute and appends #the  set value to the <attr_name>_history array
          class_eval "your code here, use %Q for multiline strings"
        end
      end

      class Foo
        attr_accessor_with_history :bar
      end
      f = Foo.new
      f.bar = 1
      f.bar = 2
      f.bar_history # => if your code works, should be [nil,1,2]
      ```

# Part 5. iterators, blocks, yield
Given two enumerable collections (of possibly different lengths), we want to get the Cartesian product of the
 collections—in other words, every possible pair of N elements where one element is drawn from each collection.
For example, the Cartesian product of the Array `x==[:a,:b,:c]` and the Range `y==4..5` is:
```ruby
x×y == [[:a,4],[:a,5],[:b,4],[:b,5],[:c,4],[:c,5]]
```

Implement a CartesianProduct class with an initialize method and each method. The each method should be an
iterator that iterates the elements of the Cartesian product, one at a time.  Each element of the Cartesian
 product is a two-element array.
*	It doesn't matter what order the elements are iterated.  So for the above example, the
ordering `[:a,4], [:b,4], [:c,4], [:a,5], [:b,5], [:c,5]` would be correct, as would any other
 ordering.
*	It does matter that within each pair, the order of the elements matches the order in
which the original collections were provided. That is, `[:a,4]` is a member of the Cartesian
 product x×y, but `[4,:a]` is not.  (Although `[4,:a]` is a member of the Cartesian product y×x.]
To start you off, skeleton code, showing possible correct results, is shown below

      ```ruby
      class CartesianProduct
        include Enumerable
        def initialize(a,b)
          # your code here
        end
        def each
          # your code here
        end
      end

      #Examples of use
      c = CartesianProduct.new([:a,:b], [4,5])
      c.each { |elt| puts elt.inspect }
      # [:a, 4]
      # [:a, 5]
      # [:b, 4]
      # [:b, 5]

      c = CartesianProduct.new([:a,:b], [])
      c.each { |elt| puts elt.inspect }
      # (nothing printed since Cartesian product
      # of anything with an empty collection is empty)
      ```

Since we will be using automated tools to grade your homework assignments, it is important
 that you carefully follow these submission instructions:

Submission Instructions (Follow these EXACTLY):

1.	Each part of the assignment must be in a separate file.  All of the files must be in the
 /lib directory of your hw-ruby-advanced-{githubname} repo.  The files must be named part1.rb, part2.rb etc.
1.	The files should contain only the ruby code specified in the assignment--i.e. all test
code and/or other extraneous code should be stripped out of the file before submission.
 As described in the header of the lib/part1.rb file, you can run sanity checks on your
 ruby files before submitting them.  This will insure that your files are compatible with
 our automatic grading tools.  Passing the sanity checks does NOT insure that your solution is complete.
1.	Commit your solutions to github under the master branch of your hw-ruby-advanced-{githubid} project.  Commit early, commit often.
1.      Copy your final solutions to codio for final grading.
